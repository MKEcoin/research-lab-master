## About this Project

MiniNero is a reimplementation of CryptoNote one-time ring signatures in Python, and is roughly analogous with the way they are implemented in MKEcoin. The main source that was used for creating MiniNero are the functions contained in crypto.cpp and crypto-ops.cpp in MKEcoin. MiniNero produces working and valid ring signatures, although they differ slightly from the MKEcoin ring signatures due to hashing and packing differences between the libraries used.
